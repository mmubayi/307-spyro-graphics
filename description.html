  <p> This project was inspired by the GBA game, Spyro: Season of Ice which I played 
  very often as a child. I modeled a section of the first level of the game, which
  is called the Autumn Fairy Home.

  <p> <b> Major concepts: </b>
  <ul> 
  <li> Hierarchical Modeling </li> 
  <li> Material, lighting and shading </li>
  <li> Texture mapping </li>
  <li> Transparency </li>
  <li> Curved lines and surfaces</li>

<div id = "castle facade"> 
  <h3> Castle Facade </h3>
  
  <img src="sample_pics/castle-facade.png" alt="front view of the castle turrets" width="400">
  <p> This facade of a castle uses hierarchical modeling with two separate 
  geometries to make the whole turret, texture mapping for the grey stone wall 
  and red and white speckled roof.
  </p>


</div>

<div id = "terrain blocks"> 
  <h2> Terrain Blocks </h2>
  <img src="sample_pics/block-steps.png" alt="front view of one of the block clusters" width="400">
  <p> The clusters of terrain blocks use hierarchical modeling to make a clusters 
  out of individual blocks, texture mapping using the 12 faces of each Box Geometry 
  to show terrain on top and soil everywhere else. 
  </p>


</div>

<div id = "frozen fairy"> 
  <h3> Frozen Fairy </h3>
  <img src="sample_pics/frozen-fairy.png" alt="front view of frozen gem" width="400">
  <p> This fairy frozen inside a crystal uses transparency of the hierarchically 
  modeled gem to give it a frozen look. It uses two separate geometries for the 
  middle section of the crystal to allow the fairy to show through from behind.
  </p>

</div>

<div id = "portal"> 
  <h3> Portal </h3>
  <img src="sample_pics/portal.png" alt="front view of portal" width="400">
  <p> The portal uses a bezier curve with tube geometry for the arch doorway and a bezier
  surface geometry for the actual portal, with texture mapping to show the portal 
  entrance. The texture is double sided to give the effect that portal seemingly 
  enters another world.
